Root Cause: not handle map with duplicate keys
Expected output: Error
When parsing a map in the nosj format, it's crucial to ensure that each key is unique.
When parsing each key-value pair, check if the key already exists in the map you're building.
If the key already exists, raise an error indicating that the input map contains duplicate keys.
If the key doesn't exist, add it to the map as usual.
