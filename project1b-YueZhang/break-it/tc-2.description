Root cause: not handle cases where the input map contains a very large decimal number as a value for a key.

Use appropriate data types that can handle large numbers without loss of precision.
In Python, the built-in int and float types can handle large numbers, but for extremely large floating-point numbers,
using libraries like decimal.Decimal is a good way to handle the extremely large floating-point number.
